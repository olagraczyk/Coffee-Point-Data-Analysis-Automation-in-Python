# Coffee-Point-Data-Analysis-Automation-in-Python
This project implements ABC and FRM analysis for Coffee Point data using Python. It features data generation, inventory automation, and simulations, all executed in a Jupyter Notebook.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on **ABC and FRM analysis** for **Coffee Point data**, integrating various automation applications using **Python**. The analysis covers **sales data, product inventory, and order popularity**, aiming to enhance data management and operational efficiency.

## Features Implemented
- **Generating Data**
- **ABC Analysis**
- **FRM Analysis**
- **Automation Applications**:
  - Inventory data processing
  - Free sample distribution
  - Simulation of data changes

## How to Use
The entire project is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**. To see the results, **execute the cells sequentially**. The notebook will generate **Excel files** at different steps, allowing you to download and review how simulated data changes after each analysis step, such as adding **FRM analysis**.
